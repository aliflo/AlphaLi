<h2>Manual for AlphaLi</h2>
<p>AlphaLi is a program for analysing data and visualising graphs. It focuses on two main datasets: global Malaria cases and google search trends for the term "Artificial Intelligence", but also supports user-uploaded data.</p>
<p>It was created as part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Project_Qualification">EPQ</a>&nbsp;project by Tom Birkbeck and Callum Cafferty.</p>
<h3>1. Using the program</h3>
<p>Once the program is launched, you can see four buttons along the left hand side.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Canvas Manipulator</strong> - This button allows you to manipulate canvas scale, zoom and change pen colour as well as clearing the canvas. Clicking it will open a menu that displays these options.</li>
<li><strong>Equation&nbsp;</strong>- This button, when pressed, prompts the user to enter an equation which will then be graphed. This allows the user to compare a plotted dataset to a simple model.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis&nbsp;</strong>- Pressing this button brings up the Data Analysis menu, which allows the user to select the two inbuilt datasets or enter/upload their own and perform different kinds of regression on them.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Canvas&nbsp;</strong>- Clears any lines that have been drawn on the canvas</li>
<li><strong>Manual&nbsp;</strong>- Button to open this page in the default web browser. This page is an html file saved in the program folders and is located by the python program and launched through the default launcher.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Canvas Manipulator</h3>
<p>The canvas manipulator allows you to customize various parts of the canvas to your needs or save the canvas to a file type of your choice. The details of each function are listed below: </p>

<h3>3. Data Analysis</h3>
<p>[guide to the data analysis menu]</p>
<h3>4. Equation</h3>
<p>When pressed, this button brings a prompt box for the user to type into. Polynomials are supported, of degree 1, 2 and 3. The user should enter the equation as a text string with no scientific notation and using only numbers and x. Valid examples include:</p>
<table style="height: 104px;" width="495">
